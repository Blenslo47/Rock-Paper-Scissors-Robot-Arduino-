# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Robot-Arduino-

Hi,

This is the page for the Rock Paper Scissors 9001.

It includes all code and design files that you need to make your own. It runs on an
arduino mega BUT can be use with an arduino nano or uno. 

It can be a fun project for everyone with a basic knowledge of the arduino platform.

You need to 3D print all of the parts for the robot. (You can also print with online services like PCBWay or 
JLCPCB if you don't have a 3D printer.
